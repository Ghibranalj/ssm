#+title: Specification

This is how the configuration works
#+begin_src yaml
config:
  port: 8080
  services:
    - endpoint: /simplemail
      email: something@gmail.com
      cred-env: SOMETHING
      default-dest:
        - something@gmail
      default-cc:
        - cc@gmail.com
      body-format: {body}
#+end_src
The credentials will be written in .env

The request to the endpoint will be a post request and the body will look like this 
#+begin_src json
{
"from": "email@emailprovider.com",
"subject": "subject of email",
"cc" : []
"dest": []
"bcc": []
"body": ""
}
#+end_src
